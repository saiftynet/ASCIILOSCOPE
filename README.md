# ASCIILOSCOPE
An oscilloscope in ASCII

The objective of this utility is to create a real time graphical monitoring of changing data from a terminal. The target applications may be monitoring electrical signals.  Clearly this is not as representative as a true graphical display, but it allows a simple illustration of input changes.  For my purposes it will allow me to select multipliers and offsets adjustments for signal captures by sensors for other applications.  It is also a test bed for the development of CursesSprites and eventual PerlayStation Terminal Games Console.  The development of these have been temporarily paused while I improve my understanding of terminal applications development (I am thinking of eventually disposing of Curses altogether).

Ihe display can be positioned and sized as needed. The Keyboard is monitored for functions to be added as development continues

Things to do: -

* Manual scale and offset adjustment (done in v0.02)
* Manual sample rate adjustment      (done in v0.02)
* Autoscaling is already implemented (in v0.02 can now be triggered any time)
* Drift adjustment                   (done in v0.04)
* Colour                             (done in v0.05)
* Multiple independent traces        (done in v0.05)
* Triggers and Storage modes         
* Freeze frame                       (partly done in v0.04) 
* Export data to CSV and graphically to SVG
* Data anaylsis
